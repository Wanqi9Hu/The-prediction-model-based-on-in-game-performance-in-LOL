## Introduction

League Of Legends (LOL) is one of the most popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games in the world. Millions of players are eager to improve their proficiency and win the games. This research builds a reflection machine for common players to review their in-game performance and therefore improve their ability. The essence of the reflection machine is a within-game predictor using the in-game stats as inputs to predict the conditions of in-game critical points and the final win/lose result. By comparing the prediction and the real performance, the player can learn more from the previous match. The final accuracy of win/lose prediction reaches 75.04% which proves the reliability of the model. From the research, we also find that the First Baron is the decisive factor in winning the game. This can be a useful suggestion for all common players.
